# Oscar Predictions â€“ F# Console Application

## Overview

This project is a simple F# console application built to predict probable Oscar-winning movies based on their IMDB ratings. It demonstrates foundational F# concepts covered in lectures, such as:

- Discriminated Unions
- Record Types
- List Filtering and Mapping
- Modular File and Folder Structure

The application filters a list of movie records using specific criteria and converts their runtime into readable formats. The goal is to stay within the scope of the assignment while improving structure and readability for maintainability and clarity.

## Credit

Minor structural enhancements were made with guidance from Microsoft Copilot, including help generating the .fsproj file and structuring the filtering logic.
